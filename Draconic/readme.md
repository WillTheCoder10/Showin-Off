This is a long one; this is all my *major* aliasing code for TWR.

If you are interested in what the "load_gvar()"s lead to (Mainly jsons to be able to edit databases without having to update the code for the end user, but some leads to modules), look at https://avrae.io/dashboard/gvars
Once you are there, press the "lookup" tab and paste the gvar id.
